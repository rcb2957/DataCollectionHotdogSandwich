##Introduction

My name is Riley Brotz.  I am a Summer 2022 Intern here at M&T.

##Minimum Requirements

The program asks the question "Does the year a person is entering M&T impact their
view on whether or not a hotdog is a sandwich?" Following this question is a bar graph 
showing the number of Interns, 2021 TDPs, and 2020 TDPs who think a hotdog is a 
sandwich.  The data has found that 2020 TDPs were more likely to say that a hotdog is 
not a sandwich and 2021 TDPs were more likely to say that a hotdog is a sandwich.
Interns as a group did not have a strong leaning towards either conviction.
